//! Pipeline operators and the [`Push`] trait that composes them.
//!
//! A pipeline is a tree of [`Push`] nodes built inside-out: every operator
//! owns its downstream (`next`), so the whole graph is one concrete type and
//! all calls are statically dispatched. Interior nodes transform or route
//! data; the leaves are [`terminal`] sinks that persist state.
//!
//! # Deltas
//! Data flows through the graph as `(data, delta)` pairs, where `delta` is a
//! signed multiplicity: `+n` inserts `n` copies of `data`, `-n` retracts
//! them. Every operator and sink honors retraction, which is what makes the
//! materialized state incrementally maintainable — pushing a record and later
//! pushing it again with the opposite delta leaves every sink unchanged.
//!
//! # Operators
//! Stateless operators forward transformed deltas immediately:
//! - [`Map`] — apply a function to each datum
//! - [`Filter`] — drop data failing a predicate
//! - [`FilterMap`] — map and filter in one step
//! - [`FlatMap`] — expand each datum into zero or more outputs
//!
//! Stateful operators persist per-element state in their own keyspace,
//! buffering within a transaction and emitting downstream deltas at commit:
//! - [`Distinct`] — collapse multiplicities to set semantics
//! - [`Aggregate`] — per-key incremental aggregation
//! - [`TopK`] — retain the k highest-scored records, retracting the rest
//! - [`Retain`] — retract records once they age past a wall-clock horizon
//!
//! Keying operators convert between plain and [`Keyed`] streams:
//! - [`KeyBy`] — attach a key extracted from each datum
//! - [`Unkey`] — discard the key, forwarding the value
//!
//! Scoring operators do the same for [`Scored`] streams:
//! - [`ScoreBy`] — attach an ordering score extracted from each datum
//! - [`Unscore`] — discard the score, forwarding the value
//!
//! # Fan-out
//! Tuples of `Push` nodes (up to 16 elements) implement `Push` by
//! broadcasting each delta to every element, splitting a pipeline into
//! parallel branches. The tuple's reader is the tuple of its elements'
//! readers.

/// Implemented by operators (which transform and forward), sinks (which
/// persist), and tuples of nodes (which fan out). A node's lifecycle:
///
/// 1. [`init`](Push::init) — once, when the owning
///    [`Stream`](crate::stream::Stream) opens: resolve keyspaces, claim sink
///    names.
/// 2. [`push`](Push::push) — once per delta within a write transaction.
///    Stateful nodes typically buffer here rather than touching the store.
/// 3. [`commit`](Push::commit) — as the transaction completes, and before
///    each mid-transaction read ([`Tx::rtx`](crate::stream::Tx::rtx)):
///    flush buffered state and emit any resulting downstream deltas. This
///    can run several times per transaction, with pushes resuming in
///    between, so committing must leave the node ready for more deltas.
/// 4. [`abort`](Push::abort) — instead of the final `commit` if the
///    transaction panics: discard buffered state so the node is clean for
///    the next transaction. Store writes from earlier `commit` calls in the
///    aborted transaction roll back with it.
